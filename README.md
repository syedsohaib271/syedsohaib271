Hey there! I'm Syed Sohaib Ahmed ðŸ‘‹
Just a computer nerd who loves to code âœ¨
So, I'm a student who's pretty obsessed with computers and coding. When I'm not buried in coursework, you'll find me tinkering with new programming languages or working on random projects that pop into my head at 2 AM.
Stuff I'm decent at
Java 
Python 
Some JavaScript
HTML/CSS 
Solving algorithmic puzzles (algorithms using data structures)
What I'm up to these days:
I'm trying to level up my problem-solving skills and build things that actually work! Currently bouncing between several projects while trying to maintain my sanity and social life.
I'm always trying to learn and i think i learn quickly
Learning to code is like trying to drink from a fire hose - overwhelming but exciting! Currently I'm:
Breaking (and then fixing) my own code
Watching way too many tutorial videos
Reading documentation at odd hours
Wondering why my code works when it shouldn't (and vice versa)
